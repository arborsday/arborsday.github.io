  <p>&#160;</p>

  <p>Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati are the co-founders of Ola Cabs, India's largest ride-hailing service. The two friends, both computer engineers, started Ola in Mumbai in 2011 as a response to a difficult personal experience trying to find a taxi.</p>

  <h6 class="sigil_not_in_toc">From Mumbai to the World</h6>

  <p>Ola has come a long way since its founding in 2010. Starting in Mumbai, the company quickly expanded to other cities in India, and then to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. Ola now operates in over 250 cities in India and 10 countries around the world. With over 2 million drivers, Ola is one of India's most valuable startups, valued at over $6 billion.</p>

  <h6 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Rides for Everyone</h6>

  <p>Ola's business model is based on offering convenient, affordable rides to people everywhere. Users can book a ride through the Ola app, which then matches them with a nearby driver. Ola makes money by taking a commission on each ride booked through its platform. In addition to its ride-hailing service, Ola also offers a range of other transportation options, including bikes, auto-rickshaws, and rental cars.</p>
